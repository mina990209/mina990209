### Projects :
- AI Board : 
    * Used AI algorithms to optimize the moves by the computer when playing games with different users.
- NASA Project : 
    * Integrate the data captured by the flight simulator and data from eye tracking, so these data types can be “played back” and easily aligned                    with the video data.
    * Develop a simplified “cartoon” of the flight deck as the visualization that will play back the values from the sim, such as airplane altitude, control mode, distance from way points.
- Traversal Project :
    * Created a library package to provide facilities for manipulating graphs, plus two clients that use the package.
